This is the proof of concept that STM32F407 discovery board can serve as Seren simple VoIP client even with speex echo cancelation. Opus codec is used to encode/decode microphone/speaker PCM data. 

LAN8720 wiring:
PC1     -> ETH_MDC
PA1     -> ETH_REF_CLK
PA2     -> ETH_MDIO
PA7     -> ETH_CRS_DV
PC4     -> ETH_RXD0
PC5     -> ETH_RXD1
PB11    -> ETH_TX_EN
PB12    -> ETH_TXD0
PB13    -> ETH_TXD1
PD12-15 -> LEDs (green, yellow, red, blue)
PA0     -> BUTTON

Blue LED                 -> echo canceletion is enabled.
Green, Ornange, Red LEDs -> speaker buffer state (Green: OK, Orange: near underrun, Red: underrun)

STM32F407 discovery board MP45DT02 microphone will be used but you have to connect some speaker with 3.5mm jack.
F407 disco board is listening at 192.168.12.6:4321. Incomming call from seren client is automaticaly accepted. User button can be used to disable/enable echo cancellation.

Build instructions:
1. install gcc-arm-none-eabi and stm-utils
2. build networking: cd networking; make
3. build opus: cd opus; make
5. build libspeexdsp: cd libspeex; make
5. copy libarm_cortexM4lf_math.a library from ST-CUBE to project root dir (Reason? I'am not sure about the license)
6. make
7. burn reulting image: st-flash write build/f407_discovery_project_example.bin 0x8000000

Run instructions:
1. run seren and select CLEAR mode(/e 0) at some other computer (for example: ./seren -p 4321 -d plughw -D plughw -vvv)
2. call STM32F407 (/c 192.168.12.6 4321)
3. enjoy the echo free call:)
